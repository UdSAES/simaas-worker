This repository contains the source code that actually implements the functionality offered _as a Service_ via the {simaas_api}[SIMaaS-API] developed at the https://www.uni-saarland.de/en/lehrstuhl/frey/start.html[chair of automation- and energy systems] at Saarland university (UdS AES).

More specifically, its capability is to execute simulations based on https://fmi-standard.org/[Functional Mock-up Units (FMUs)] using https://github.com/CATIA-Systems/FMPy[FMPy], a Python library developed at Dassault Syst√®mes.

Requests for performing simulations are distributed to the worker instances by means of a distributed task queue implemented using {celery}[Celery]. Consequently, the available computing power can easily be increased both by allowing one instance to use more cores and by starting more instances in a cluster.

== Installation
The code can be executed directly on GNU/Linux host machines or containerized using Podman or Docker. In both cases, some environment variables (ENVVARs) must be set according to the table below.

=== Configuration
All environment variables without a default value MUST be set before starting the program. Otherwise, a fatal error will be raised and the program will terminate with a non-zero exit code.

[#tbl-envvars,options="header",cols="2,5,1"]
|===
| Environment Variable
| Description
| Default Value

| `SIMWORKER_BROKER_HREF`
| The https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL#Syntax[`scheme` and `authority`-parts] of a URL pointing to the RabbitMQ-instance to be used as message broker.
| --

| `SIMWORKER_BACKEND_HREF`
| The https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL#Syntax[`scheme` and `authority`-parts] of a URL pointing to the Redis-instance to be used as result backend.
| --

| `SIMWORKER_TMPFS_PATH`
| The path at which to store temporary files. Should be a `tmpfs`-mount for better speed but can be a normal directory, too.
| --

| `SIMWORKER_TMPFS_MAXSIZE`
| The maximum amount of bytes that the temporary files are allowed to consume. Iff the total file size of all temporary files exceeds this limit, the least recently used files are deleted.
| --

| `SIMWORKER_LOG_STRUCTURED`
| Whether to output logs as JSON-objects (`"true"`) or formatted strings (`"false"`).
| `"false"`

| `SIMWORKER_LOG_LEVEL`
| The minimal included https://loguru.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/logger.html#levels[log level] that shall be printed to `stdout`.
| `"INFO"`

| `DYMOLA_RUNTIME_LICENSE`
| The path to the Dymola license file necessary to simulate FMUs created using Dymola.

Obviously this is only necessary iff the FMUs require a license to execute.
| --
|===

=== Running via `celery worker`
First, install the dependencies (specified in `pyproject.toml`/`poetry.lock`) into a new https://python-poetry.org/[Poetry]-environment using `poetry install`. Then, activate the environment (`poetry shell`) and run the commands below from within this environment.

.Running several instances with a fixed thread count
[source,sh]
----
source .env; celery -A worker worker --loglevel=INFO --concurrency=1 -n worker1@%h
source .env; celery -A worker worker --loglevel=INFO --concurrency=1 -n worker2@%h
source .env; celery -A worker worker --loglevel=INFO --concurrency=1 -n worker3@%h
----

The optimal number of worker processes/threads depends on the application -- read the https://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/userguide/workers.html#concurrency[note on concurrency in the Celery-manual].

.https://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/userguide/workers.html#autoscaling[Dynamically spawn new threads if necessary]
[source, sh]
----
source .env; celery -A worker worker --loglevel=INFO --autoscale=10,3
----

If you want to use the GUI of FMPy for testing within the Poetry-environment, you'll need to install the development dependencies as well (Poetry installs them by default) and you probably also need to https://stackoverflow.com/a/56675620[install `python3-tkinter` or similar via your operating systems package manager].

=== Running Containerized
Using Poetry for building container images is complicated/an overkill, so the dependency manifest needs to be exported in a format that `pip` can use when building the image using `poetry export -f requirements.txt --output requirements.txt --without-hashes` before attempting to build.

[source, sh]
----
poetry export -f requirements.txt --output requirements.txt --without-hashes

podman build -t simaas-worker:latest . # build and tag image
podman run \
  --name simaas-worker \
  --env SIMWORKER_BROKER_HREF=... \
  --env SIMWORKER_BACKEND_HREF=... \
  --env SIMWORKER_TMPFS_PATH=... \
  --env SIMWORKER_TMPFS_MAXSIZE=... \
  --rm -d \
  simaas-worker:latest # run as container
----

If a Dymola license is required to execute the FMUs, then you will need to mount the license file into the container and set the ENVVAR to the path under which the license is available from within the container.

== Usage
This component is not intended to be used directly -- its sole purpose is to do jobs put into the queue by an instance of the {simaas_api}[SIMaaS-API].

== Roadmap
We will work on the following issues in the near future:

* [ ] Fix the _test suite that is currently broken (!)_
* [ ] Fix type casting for enumerations
* [ ] Provide robust solution for unit mapping when generating RDF representations

We might also spend time on the following (but can't say when for sure):

* [ ] Support FMUs for model exchange
* [ ] Support version 3.0 of the FMI standard (not yet released)

== Development
_In case you find problems, have questions or ideas: please open an issue so that we can discuss it!_

Code formatting is handled by https://github.com/psf/black[`black`] and https://pycqa.github.io/isort/[`isort`], so please install the development dependencies (`poetry install --dev`) and run them before submitting a pull request.
